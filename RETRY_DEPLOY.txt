Deployment Retry Attempt
========================

Timestamp: 2025-12-22 22:40 CST
Status: Testing GitHub Actions availability
Attempt: Retry after billing update

This commit will trigger workflows if billing is resolved.

Workflows that should run:
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (bulletproof, never fails)
- ✅ Zero-Token Deploy (optional)

Expected: GREEN checkmarks if billing resolved
If still locked: RED X with billing error message
